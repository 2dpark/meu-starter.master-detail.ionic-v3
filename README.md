## Getting started


# Starting new app from starter sidemenu with Ionic CLI

```
$ ionic config set -g features.project-angular true

$ ionic start meu-starter.ionic-v3 sidemenu
? Project type: ionic-angular
? Starter template: sidemenu
? Would you like to integrate your new app with Cordova to target native iOS and Android: Yes
? Install the free Ionic Pro SDK and connect your app: Yes
```

# Create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# meu.starter.ionic-v3" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/meumobi/meu.starter.ionic-v3.git
git push -u origin master
```

# Connect app to Ionic Pro

Push your code to [Ionic Pro](https://ionicframework.com/pro) to perform real-time updates (skip the app store queue), and more: git push ionic master.

Ionic Pro uses a git-based workflow to manage app updates. If you're not familiar with on working with branches in GitHub you can read about them [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

```
? Install the free Ionic Pro SDK and connect your app? Yes
? What would you like to do? Link an existing app on Ionic Pro
? Which app would you like to link meu-starter
? Which git host would you like to use? GitHub
? Does the repository exist on GitHub? Yes
? Which GitHub repository would you like to link? meumobi / meu.starter.ionic-v3
? Which would you like to do? Link to master branch only
```

# Worflow & Build Management
## Aliases and environment variables support
- [Managing Aliases and environment variables in Ionic v3... preparing Ionic v4](http://meumobi.github.io/ionic/2018/05/10/managing-aliases-environment-variables-ionc.html)

## Documentation generation using Compodoc
- [Compodoc: Getting Started](https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/installation.html)

### Local installation
```
npm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodoc
```

### Build and serve docs
Define script tasks for it in your package.json :
```
"scripts": {
  "docs:build": "./node_modules/.bin/compodoc -d ./docs/ -p ./tsconfig.json",
  "docs:serve": "./node_modules/.bin/compodoc -s -d ./docs"
}
```

and run it like a normal npm script, to generate documentation :

```
$ npm run docs:build
```

To serve the generated documentation:

```
$ npm run docs:serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`

You can exclude files from the generated documentation by using 'exclude' in tsconfig.json:

```
  "exclude": [
    "./node_modules",
    "./temp/**/*.ts",
    "./src/environments/*.ts",
    "./src/services/**/*.ts",
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ]
```
## Unit testing and end-to-end (e2e)
- [Leif Wells's blog: Configure Existing Ionic Projects for Testing](https://leifwells.github.io/2017/08/27/testing-in-ionic-configure-existing-projects-for-testing/)

The important modules are `karma`, `jasmine` and `protractor`:
- `karma` is our testing environment for unit testing. 
- `jasmine` is the unit testing framework. 
- `protractor` is our testing environment for our end-to-end tests. 

The rest of the modules are utilities that allow this configuration to work.
